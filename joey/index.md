## Well that didn't work!

Hey, Kevin here.

All Aboard! didn't work out as planned so we're shutting it down to pursue other projects. After pivoting 4 times and releasing 2 different products in 2015 we just didn't see the demand.

And - to be perfectly honest - after 2 1/2 years of bootstrapping SaaS products as a single founder I'm ready to do something else.

Part of my wind-down process for All Aboard is making sure my team lands at a great gig. Since my team is awesome this is also pretty fun. :-)

## Meet Joey Mendoza, developer

(that's Joey on the right in case you're wondering ...)

You can read Joey's LinkedIn Profile [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josemarimendoza). But let me take a moment to share my personal experience from working with him for nearly 2 years.

Joey worked with me day-to-day as the primary dev lead building SoHelpful and All Aboard. He lives in Manila and most of our conversations were over Skype, Slack, or GitHub.

### Joey is a godsend to have in a startup because:

+ He has been a startup founder himself before and is able to **look at things from the founder's perspective**.
+ He has a ton of dev experience and **can pick up anything**.
+ He is **comfortable dealing with startup chaos** and doesn't get frustrated when the plan changes. And changes again. And again ...
+ He is a fun guy and just **so easy to work with**.

### So ... what "kind" of developer is he?

You'll notice that I haven't mentioned Joey's technical skills - and for a good reason.

I was primarily looking for a Rails/Javascript developer when I interviewed Joey 2 years ago. I liked him instantly and realized he was the kind of person I wanted on my team. Unfortunately ... he didn't know Ruby or Rails and most of his tech experience was in Java and Android development.

When I pressed him about my concern, he assured me, "No worries, I can learn it."

And he did. Although I had 2+ years of self-taught Rails experience, Joey surpassed me within 3 months. He just got the code and started figuring it out.

Bottom line: Joey can - and will - learn anything you throw at him.

## Want to talk to Joey about getting his help?

If you're interested in hiring **Joey please email him at jose.mari.mendoza@gmail.com**.

I would ask that you only contact him if you have a specific project and the budget to pay senior-level developer rates in Manila.

As I'm sure you already know, developers with Joey's experience are in high demand everywhere.
