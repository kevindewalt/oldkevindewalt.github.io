> The most common unscalable thing founders have to do at the start is to recruit users manually. Nearly all startups have to. You can't wait for users to come to you. You have to go out and get them.

## There’s a myth that almost killed our startup, SoHelpful.me

And it goes like this:

>To create successful users, make your customer onboarding as fast, short, and painless, as possible.

It seems to make sense… It also does not work.

We were successfully signing up new customers. Even getting them to pay upfront. We’ve cracked the nut on the hardest part!!

Time to pump cash into the money machine, right?

Unfortunately, no. **Yep, customers were signing up. But they were also churning right off.**

They liked and bought the idea. But our onboarding wasn't great, so our new customers didn't know how to use SoHelpful.

They couldn’t see how our product fits into their lives. 

So we did what we knew best: We called each and every one of our customers to help them use SoHelpful to achieve their goals.

**It worked, but it also made us feel like a fake.** Calling every customer takes time. It’s not very efficient. And it doesn’t scale.

We thought it was just us… After all, REAL SaaS products have smooth onboarding, beautiful UIs, and customers instantly know how to use them, right?

Actually, no.

##Doing things that don’t scale: How successful startups create customers that love them

**Pinterest** could’ve looked at heat maps and analytics. Instead, they went to cafes and asked random people to try their website. 

When Patrick McKenzie emailed **Stripe**, they could’ve replied with a “Thanks for the email. Please see our FAQ.“ Instead, cofounder Patrick Collisson not only diagnosed the problem, but emailed to say he already fixed it for McKenzie.

**AirBNB** could’ve wrote an email autoresponder explaining how to write an effective listing. Instead, Brian and Joe went door to door in NYC and took professional photos of their users’ houses.

##Why isn't anybody talking about this?

Selling is hard, but it's important. Everybody talks about it. Knowing this, we work extra hard to get customers to pay for our products.

**Know what’s harder AND more important than sales?**

Getting customers to not only use your product, but get value from -- and pay for -- it month over month.

In other words, a good onboarding process.

Problem is, creating and optimizing an automated onboarding process takes a long time. YEARS. But nobody talks about how hard it actually is.

We see successful startups and their sleek customer onboarding flows and think we should copy it.

But the fact is, it took YEARS to get to this point.

Sure, it’s how they’re scaling their startups... But when they first launched, they did things that do not scale.

**Few startups realize this, and it’s killing us.**

We think it’s time we do something about it.

##Join our journey across the US to discover true stories of how successful startups actually got there

From March to April 2015, I am going to travel all over the US. From San Francisco to Boulder to New York...

And I'm going to get startups to answer this question:

>What did you have to do to get customers to start using your product?

I'm also going to ask them:

+ What their customer onboarding process looked like when they first launched
+ Why customers weren't using their product
+ What ideas they tried, what worked, what didn't, and mistakes they made
+ How they dealt with the fact that these activities were not scalable.
+ When is it time to move on?
+ Will it still work if someone does this today?
