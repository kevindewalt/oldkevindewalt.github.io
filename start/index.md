This site is for B2B SaaS apps.

Here you'll learn about the concierge onboarding movement, how SaaS companies are using it to learn what their customers want and double (or greater) their trial-to-paid conversion.

And ... yes ... you'll learn how you can do it too.

# What is "concierge onboarding?" And why do we care so much about it?

Let's start with a fairy tale called *The Magical Money Machine*.

<img class="post-image" src = "{{site.image_url}}/castle.jpg">

### The Magical Money Machine

Once upon a time ...

Joe and his friends had an idea for a SaaS app. They did customer development, built and MVP, and customers started using it.

Every month they diligently worked away getting the product better, built more features and analyzed data. They discovered points of friction in their application and began solving them with onboarding emails, targeted messaging, and better UI.

Gradually their important metrics: conversion percentages, churn, lifetime value all got better and better.

They raised an A round of funding to do advertising and content marketing to drive more customers into the front of their application.

With a sticky product, growth strategy, and fixed costs Joe and his friends created a Magical Money Machine that made all of them rich.

Two years later they sold to Salesforce and spent the rest of their days hanging out with Jason Fried and Derek Sivers.

The end.

### Why this is a fairy tale

I used to believe that building a SaaS app didn't require a 1-on-1 approach to sales. That a good product, good UI, and good funnel lead to profits.

It didn't work that way for us - we needed to get most of customers on the phone to convert or retain them. We thought we were the exception until I talked to other SaaS founders who experienced the same reality. They told us things like ...

> We just couldn't convert customers without getting them on the phone. We thought it was because our product onboarding sucked - but we learned it was more about them.

Then we started talking to more successful companies like [Customer.io]({{site.blogroot}}/customerio), [Helpscout]({{site.blogroot}}/helpscout), [Drip]({{site.blogroot}}/robwalling) - and learned how much they "did things that don't scale" to get cutomers using their products.

There is no Magical Money Machine - you're going to have to work hard to convert your trial customers to subscribers or lose to someone who does.

### Real SaaS companies do "concierge" onboarding

It turns out customers don't always know what they want. They're not always ready to make the behavior changes necessary to use your product. And they're overwhelmed with everyone else trying to sell them stuff.

These are all barriers that prevent them from becoming a paying subscriber - barriers that are really, really hard to overcome with technology.

It's actually **easier to increase conversions by getting customers on a call - a process called "concierge" onboarding**.

# Is concierge onboarding for you?

Do you want ... MORE MONEY? Of course you do! If so, this is for you.

Ok, that sounds like an bad TV informercial - and it isn't true because concierge onboarding *isn't* for every business (or even every SaaS business).

### You can definitely stop reading now if ...

1. Your business is a **1-time sale** - like a ebook or physical product.
2. Your product is **simple &amp; obvious** - like a search engine.
3. You're competing on **price**.

### You can probably stop reading now if ...

1. You're building a **free, ad-driven** consumer product.
2. You have an **expensive product** sold at the CXO level through a dedicated sales force.

### This is for you if ...

1. You charge a **subscription**.
2. Your product (from a customer perspective) is **complex**.
3. You compete on **value**.

### And this is a complete ... no-brainer ... you're-losing-money-by-NOT-doing-this (and causing this poor puppy to cry) if ...

1. Your product requires customers to **change behavior**.
2. You're selling a product priced between **$20-$1,000/month**.

Allright, I made up the part about the crying puppy.

But most B2B SaaS apps are in this category. The successful ones are doing concierge onboarding because they need a cost-effective way to convert their most qualified trial customers into paying subscribers.

Like most SaaS apps, we spent way too much time thinking lack of prospects at the "top of the funnel" was causing our slow growth. Here's [.

What's "onboarded" anyway? The most popular definition is 'once a user achieves “initial success” with your product' but plenty of our trial customers take a critical step, get some “First Value” - and then abandon the product a week later. So here's a more practical definition:
