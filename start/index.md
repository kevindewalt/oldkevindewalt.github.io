This site is for founders, customer success &amp; onboarding specialists at B2B SaaS apps.

Here you'll learn about the concierge onboarding movement, how SaaS companies are using it to learn what their customers want and double (or greater) their trial-to-paid conversion.

And ... yes ... you'll learn how you can do it too.

# What is "concierge onboarding?" And why do we care so much about it?

Let's start with a fairy tale called *The SaaS Magical Money Machine*.

<img class="post-image" src = "{{site.image_url}}/castle.jpg">

### The SaaS Magical Money Machine

*Once upon a time ...*

Joe and his friends had an idea for a SaaS app. They did customer development, built and MVP, and customers started using it.

Every month they diligently worked at getting the product better, building more features and analyzing data. They discovered points of customer friction and began solving them with onboarding emails, targeted messaging, and better UI.

Each month conversion percentages, churn, and lifetime value all got better and better. They started doing growth hacking to drive more customers into their application...and the money rolled in.

With a sticky product, growth strategy, and fixed costs Joe and his friends created a SaaS Magical Money Machine that made all of them rich.

Two years later they sold to Salesforce and spent the rest of their lives hanging out with Derek Sivers.

The end.

### Why this is a fairy tale

I used to believe that building a SaaS app didn't require a 1-on-1 approach to sales. That a good product, good UI, and good funnel lead to profits.

It didn't work that way for us - we needed to get most of customers on the phone to convert or retain them. We thought we were the exception until I talked to other SaaS founders who experienced the same reality. They told us things like ...

> We just couldn't convert customers without getting them on the phone. We thought it was because our product onboarding sucked - but we learned it was more about them.

Then we started talking to more successful companies like [Customer.io]({{site.blogroot}}/customerio), [Helpscout]({{site.blogroot}}/helpscout), [Drip]({{site.blogroot}}/robwalling), and [PayByPhone]({{site.blogroot}}/davidspittel/) - and learned how much they "did things that don't scale" to get cutomers using their products.

There is no SaaS Magical Money Machine, no way to make happy paying customers with data and products alone.

### Real SaaS companies do "concierge" onboarding

In the real world, customers:

+ don't always know what they want,
+ or understand their problems,
+ and they're not ready to make the behavior changes necessary to use your product.

So they sign up ... poke around ... and disapear because these barriers are hard to overcome with technology.

It's actually **easier to increase conversions by getting customers on a call - a process called "concierge" onboarding**.

# Is concierge onboarding for you?

Do you want ... MORE MONEY? Of course you do! If so, this is for you.

Ok, that sounds like an bad TV informercial - and it isn't true because concierge onboarding *isn't* for every business (or even every SaaS business).

### You can definitely stop reading now if ...

1. Your business is a **1-time sale** - like a ebook or physical product.
2. Your product is **simple &amp; obvious** - like a search engine.
3. You're competing on **price**.

### You can probably stop reading now if ...

1. You're building a **free, ad-driven** consumer product.
2. You have an **expensive product** sold top-down at the CXO level through a dedicated sales force.

### This is for you if ...

1. You charge a **subscription**.
2. Your product (from a customer perspective) is **complex**.
3. You compete on **value**.

### And this is a complete ... no-brainer ... you're-losing-money-by-NOT-doing-this (and causing this poor puppy to cry) if ...

1. You are pre-product/market fit and looking for insight.
2. Your product requires customers to **change behavior**.
2. You're selling a product priced between **$20-$1,000/month**.

<img class="post-image" src = "{{site.image_url}}/sad_puppy.jpg">

Allright, I made up the part about the crying puppy.

But **most B2B SaaS apps are in this situation**. The successful ones are doing concierge onboarding because they need a cost-effective way to convert their most qualified trial customers into paying subscribers.

# Create your concierge onboarding strategy

### Have a clear, measurable objective

Do you know *when* your customers are onboarded? Do the people on your team have a common definition of what it means to be onboarded.

We like simple, measurable metrics and define onboarded as ...

> A SaaS customer who pays twice (monthly plan) or pays once and use a product for more than 60 days (quarterly and longer plan) is “onboarded”.

More:

[How to know when your customer is onboarded]({{site.blogroot}}/defining-onboarded/)

### Divide your customers into 3 groups

<u>Still Onboarding Group</u> - Anyone who signed up for your product within the last 60 days who

* Hasn’t paid twice (monthly plan)
* Has paid once and use the product for < 60 days (quarterly or longer plan)

<u>Onboarded Group</u> - Any active, paying subscriber who

* Has paid 2x or more (monthly plan)
* Has paid 1x and used the product for more than 60 days (quarterly or longer plan)

<u>Not Onboarded Group</u> - Basically, everyone else. A customer who

* Signed up more than 60 days ago and never paid.
* Had a subscription and canceled.

### Identify qualifying criteria for your Onboarded Group

Review the customers in your <u>Onboarded Group</u> who are providing the most value to you. Identify their common characteristics.

* Who are they?
* What have they done in your application?
* What plan have they signed up for?

Your goal is to find more customers like this, invest in them during the onboarding process and try to convert them.

### Qualify your Still Onboarding Customers

Now review everyone in your <u>Still Onboarding Group</u> group and qualify them based on the criteria from Step 2.

These are your <u>Qualified Onboarding Customers</u>.

# Start converting your most qualified customers

Now take a few weeks to invest time in this group. I don't suggest you spend a lot of time doing product work - instead contact them, look at their goals, and get them on a call to help them achieve them.
