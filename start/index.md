This site is for B2B SaaS apps.

Here you'll learn about the concierge onboarding movement, how SaaS companies are using it to learn what their customers want and double (or greater) their trial-to-paid conversion.

And ... yes ... you'll learn how you can do it too.

# What is "concierge onboarding?" Is this for you?

Do you want ... MORE MONEY? Of course you do! If so, this is for you.

Ok, that sounds like an bad TV informercial - and it isn't true because concierge onboarding *isn't* for every business (or even every SaaS business).

### You can definitely stop reading now if ...

1. Your business is a **1-time sale** - like a ebook or physical product.
2. Your product is **simple &amp; obvious** - like a search engine.
3. You're competing on **price**.

### You can probably stop reading now if ...

1. You're building a **free, ad-driven** consumer product.
2. You have an **expensive product** sold at the CXO level through a dedicated sales force.

### This is for you if ...

1. You charge a **subscription**.
2. Your product (from a customer perspective) is **complex**.
3. You compete on **value**.

### And this is a complete ... no-brainer ... you're-losing-money-by-NOT-doing-this (and causing puppies to cry) if ...

1. Your product requires customers to **change behavior**.
2. You're selling a product priced between **$20-$1,000/month**.

Ok. I made up the part about the crying puppies. But most B2B SaaS apps are in this category. The successful ones are doing concierge onboarding because they need a cost-effective way to convert their most qualified trial customers.

# Why we became passionate advocates for concierge onboarding




Like most SaaS apps, we spent way too much time thinking lack of prospects at the "top of the funnel" was causing our slow growth. Here's [how we became concierge onboarding evangelists](http://blog.sohelpful.io/about/).

What's "onboarded" anyway? The most popular definition is 'once a user achieves “initial success” with your product' but plenty of our trial customers take a critical step, get some “First Value” - and then abandon the product a week later. So here's a more practical definition:
