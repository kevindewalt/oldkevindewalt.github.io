tl;dr - A SaaS customer who **pays twice** (monthly plan) or **pays once and use a product for more than 60 days** (quarterly and longer plan) is “onboarded”.

<br>

 Yes, yes ... I know ... I am a bit obsessive. Only the truly obsessed would bother to write a blog post about definitions. I guess it just comes with being an entrepreneur, but having a common language is important. So I obsess about things like the actual definition of "onboarding".

I spent the past 6 months talking to other SaaS product founders about onboarding. How they do it. What works. What doesn’t.

I've noticed that companies use the term "onboarding" so differently. There isn’t even a good definition of what it means for a customer to be “onboarded”.

To paraphrase a conversation I had with Ville Laurikari, founder of [PressRush](https://www.pressrush.com/):

> Onboarding is such a new idea, we didn’t really start talking about it in the tech community until a few years ago. The conversations are all over the place, we don’t even have good terminology.

## When are your customers “onboarded”?

Ville is right. Google “onboarding” and you’ll find product discussions about sign-up workflow, improving UI. But nobody has really defined it.

We know when onboarding begins - when customer signs up for our product. But when does it end? When does a customer enter the "onboarded" state?

When they finish signing up?

Once the customer has achieved some “initial success”?

When they first pay?

So far the best definition I can find is [by Lincoln Murphy](http://sixteenventures.com/customer-onboarding):

> So, since it’s hard to nail it down and there’s no universal definition for it, I prefer to consider a customer “onboarded” once they’ve achieved “initial success” with your product (consider this First Value Delivered – FVD).

(Read that post by Lincoln - it is excellent.)

Well … ok. I get it. But I've seen plenty of instances where our trial customers take a critical step, get some “First Value” - and then abandon the product a week later.

Plus agreeing on “First Value” is so subjective, particularly when you have multiple segments. Defining FVD and working towards it (which is Lincoln’s main message) is a critical part of an onboarding workflow but simply getting a customer to that point doesn’t represent anything.

## So what? Why do we need a good definition of “onboarded”.

Because we need measure what is actually happening in our businesses so we know what to do. Consider, for instance, churn.

Let’s say you offer a free 14-day trial. Some customers will sign up and never use it, some will use it like crazy and cancel on the 13th day, some will barely use it and pay once.

When do you start measuring churn?  Ideally from the point at which we expect a customer to create long-term value, when they are “onboarded”.

SaaS sales is different, and the old definitions like “customer”, “close”, don’t help us run our businesses.

## A simple, measurable, no bs definition of “onboarded” for SaaS companies

I don’t know about you, but I like simple. I would rather use a simple, measurable metric than a subjective one. And I like metrics based on money; the debates and bull$--t stops when customers stop paying.

<br>

A SaaS customer who <strong>pays twice</strong> (monthly plan) or **pays once and use a product for more than 60 days** (quarterly and longer plan) is “onboarded”.

<br>

A perfect definition? Nope.

But it is one you can consistently measure across time … across product changes, pivots, and customer segments.

<a name="3steps"></a>
## How to use this definition to grow your SaaS MRR.

### Step 1 - Divide your customers into 3 groups

<u>Still Onboarding Group</u> - Anyone who signed up for your product within the last 60 days who

* Hasn’t paid twice (monthly plan)
* Has paid once and use the product for < 60 days (quarterly or longer plan)

<u>Onboarded Group</u> - Any active, paying subscriber who

* Has paid 2x or more (monthly plan)
* Has paid 1x and used the product for more than 60 days (quarterly or longer plan)

<u>Not Onboarded Group</u> - Basically, everyone else. A customer who

* Signed up more than 60 days ago and never paid.
* Had a subscription and canceled.

### Step 2 - Identify qualifying criteria for your Onboarded Group

Review the customers in your Onboarded Group. Identify their common characteristics.

* Who are they?
* What have they done in your application?

Your goal is to find more customers like this, invest in them during the onboarding process and try to convert them.

### Step 3 - Qualify your Onboarding Customers

Using [Chiara’s guideline]({{site.blogroot}}/qualify), review everyone in your Currently Onboarding group and qualify them based on the criteria from Step 2.

These are your <u>Qualified Onboarding Customers</u>.

### Step 4 - Invest in your Qualified Onboarding Customers

Now take a few weeks to invest time in this group. I don't suggest you spend a lot of time doing product work - instead contact them, look at their goals, and if possible get them on [a coaching call]({{site.blogroot}}/hire-coaches-to-do-saas-onboarding/).

Follow this approach and you'll free yourself from the silly product and UI issues that customers don't really care about it. Instead, you'll be investing in real relationships with the people who have the most potential to generate value for your business.
