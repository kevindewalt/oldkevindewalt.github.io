Whether to offer free trials and when to charge customers are among the most debated onboarding issues for SaaS companies. There are 4 basic strategies for increasing conversion by lowering the customers’ transactional risks:

+ freemium. A limited free plan with paid plan upgrades usually isn’t practical unless you have a bucket of VC money. So I won’t cover it here.
+ free trial (no credit card upfront).
+ free trial (with credit card).
+ pay upfront - money-back guarantee.

Here are some suggestions for identifying the right model for you.

## Don’t pick an onboarding model because “X says so”

You’ll find successful companies using all of these strategies - there is no “best” way to do onboarding.

Unfortunately I’ve met some service providers who insist that free trial (no credit card upfront) is the “best” way. Lowering the bar gets more potential customers into the pipeline, creates more metrics and generally requires more work.

Which … of course … creates more need for consulting services, analytics tools, etc. It might be the best option but it isn’t without some bias.

Do a quick Google search and you’ll also find plenty of SaaS founders writing blog articles like “we got rid of X plan and did Y and made much more $!” Great content for building an audience, but still just one anecdote.

Skip the anecdotes and come up with a strategy that fits you.

## What to consider when picking your strategy

#### Consider your market

If you’re creating a mass-market business product in a fast-growing, competitive space (e.g. Buffer) you need a data-driven strategy like free trial (no credit card) or freemium. Enterprise sales (e.g Box.com) are the other extreme where up-front payments are usually the only option.

But these are the extremes - most SaaS products are somewhere between the two.

#### Consider your entire sales funnel

Deciding when to charge customers is just one part of your entire sales funnel. Too many founders think about this step without considering everything that comes before and after it.

How will customers find your product? How will you educate them on its value? How will you engage them once they sign up?

For instance, a common mistake is deciding to offer free trials without a plan for qualifying and engaging these leads.

#### Consider your skills

What are you - the founding team - good at? Sales? Writing courses? Analytics and design?

A 45-year-old founder with 20 years of sales experience in an industry is probably wasting her time playing around with Intercom when she could be closing sales with a phone call or direct emails.

My team is pretty good at writing and teaching, ok at data analytics, and truly dreadful at design. So we’re having the most success educating prospective customers up-front, charging immediately and offering refunds.

Now let’s evaluate your options with these considerations.

## Free trial (no credit card upfront)

This approach generates the most inbound leads - a great idea if you’ve hit product-market fit and are trying to scale your business. Since you already have a product that delights customers and have solid metrics on conversions and churn it makes sense to drive as many people as possible through the product. Expect to convert 2-8% of your trial customers to paid.

You don’t need to educate potential customers about your product’s value - your product will do that once people try it. Since 90%+ of the people who try your product will never pay dime, your marketing budget will be spent on support rather than eduction.

You’ll need extensive metrics and (at least part time) resources dedicated to curating these leads and evaluating the data.

## Free trial (credit card upfront)

Asking for a credit card will reduce the number of inbound leads to your application but those who do sign up will be making a more informed decision. 20-40% of these trial customers will become paying subscribers - that is, most will cancel before getting charged.

You’ll want to have a “qualifying” strategy with this approach and invest more resources into onboarding the customers who will create the most value - usually based on who they are, how much they use the product, and how much they’re paying.

This approach is ideal if your product requires customers to change their behavior to get the most benefit from it. Do concierge onboarding with the most qualified customers and coach them on the behavior changes necessary to achieve their goals with your product.

If you’re asking for a credit card to take a free trial and treating every new customer the same - for instance, dumping them into your auto-responder - you’re throwing away money.

## Pay upfront with money-back guarantee

The final option is asking every customer to pay upfront to use your product and then offering a money-back guarantee. 90%+ customers will pay you at least once - that is, expect <10% to ask for a refund.

Of course you’ll have invest more resources educating customers upfront - for example, through a sales team, courses, or books. And you’ll lose sales to customers who won’t pay for any product unless they can try it out.

This is an ideal strategy if you haven’t hit product-market fit or if your product onboarding is clunky. You can invest more time with every new customer to learn about their problems and help them achieve their goals by creating value outside of your product - for instance, teaching them how to work differently or coaching them.

Your support costs are lowest in this approach and you won’t need to qualify leads - since they’ve all paid you will want to try to get almost all of them on a phone call.

## Just starting? Here is my advice.

Skip the free trials - and definitely skip free plans. Charge more, go out and find customers and try to convince them to use your products. Invest time in every new customer and look for ways to create value outside of your product.

Do concierge onboarding with all of them - send a personalized email to try to get them on the phone and help them achieve their goals. Don’t bother writing onboarding email autoresponders or setting up analytics tools - this stuff takes too long and you’ll learn almost nothing.

As your MRR grows and your product gets better you can begin offering free trials to scale your business.
