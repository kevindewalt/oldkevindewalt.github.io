<p>Do you run a SAAS subscription app (a website that charges a recurring fee, e.g. MailChimp )? You already know a good onboarding process is critical for getting customers to use (and pay for) your product. Many successful SAAS companies are now using “concierge” onboarding.</p>
<p>At SoHelpful we’ve been doing concierge onboarding for the last two years. It has worked so well that other companies are asking me to teach them how to do it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m even doing a new free email course called <a href="http://try.sohelpful.me/concierge.html">Double Your Paid Conversions with Concierge Onboarding</a> &#8211; you can sign up for it right now.</p>
<h2 id="benefitsofconciergeonboardingforsubscriptionservices">Benefits of concierge onboarding for subscription services</h2>
<ul>
<li>Increase conversions to paid subscribers. Customer.io found it doubled theirs.</li>
<li>Reducing churn or defection to competitors.</li>
<li>Customer Development.</li>
</ul>
<p>Today I’m going to explain how to do Customer Development during concierge onboarding.</p>
<h2 id="whatisconciergeonboarding">What is “concierge” onboarding?</h2>
<p>Concierge onboarding means getting on a phone (or Skype, Hangout, etc.) call with customers who sign up for your product and helping them 1-on–1. It is most effective when your product is complex, expensive, or requires behavior change. The 1-on–1 interaction gives you a chance to earn trust, overcome objections, or answer questions before customers cancel.</p>
<p>It is also great if you&#8217;re struggling with converting customers to paid subscribers or high churn &#8211; in that case you haven’t hit product-market fit and need to keep doing Customer Development on your new customers.</p>
<p>Sound like you? Don’t feel bad, this is typical. Here&#8217;s how you do it.</p>
<h2 id="step1-hypothesizeatsignup">Step 1 &#8211; Hypothesize at signup</h2>
<p>Take a look at who your new customer is and what she does during signup. What problem do you <strong>think</strong> she has?</p>
<p>Why did she sign up? Why did/didn’t she tack the actions? Why might she decide not to pay or cancel?</p>
<p>Discuss it with your team and document it. This exercise is great for getting the entire company engaged with the real problems you’re solving for customers.</p>
<h2 id="step2-getthecustomeronthephonenoteasy">Step 2 &#8211; Get the customer on the phone (not easy)</h2>
<p>Here is where we see most SAAS companies blow it. If you have a phone number you can try calling them directly, but 75% of the time (or more) you’ll get a voicemail or interrupt someone. You best bet is to try and get the customer to schedule a call with you.</p>
<p>Unfortunately … they will probably be reluctant to do this. The key is to position the call as an opportunity to teach/help/train the new customer so they want to get on a call. I cover this in detail <a href="http://try.sohelpful.me/concierge.html">in the course</a>, but here some examples:</p>
<h4 id="bad-lookslikeformmessagefromsalesorsupport">Bad concierge onboarding email &#8211; looks like form message from sales or support</h4>
<blockquote><p>Subject: Welcome to SuperCoolApp</p>
<p>Hello Tim,</p>
<p>Thank you for signing up for SuperCoolApp.com. Would you like to schedule a call to learn how to start using SuperCoolApp? I can help you finish the setup and answer any questions. Just hit reply and let me know.</p></blockquote>
<h4 id="good-lookslikealearningopportunityfromanauthoritywhocares">Good concierge onboarding email &#8211; looks like a learning opportunity from an authority who cares</h4>
<blockquote><p>Subject: SuperCoolApp (I hand-typed this email Tim)</p>
<p>Hey Tim,</p>
<p>I’m Jack, a founder of SuperCoolApp. I also teach our customers’ sales teams how to accelerate revenue using the CoolSeller technique.</p>
<p>Thanks for signing up &#8211; I took a quick look at your company’s website at http://timscompany.com. (I see you’re in Orlando &#8211; I go there once/year to teach sales workshops, nice city). Let’s get on a call and talk about your company and goals. I may be able to offer a few easy tips but want to first understand your goals. To schedule a call with me …</p></blockquote>
<h2 id="step3-leadthecallwithgrowcoaching">Step 3 &#8211; Lead the call with GROW coaching</h2>
<p>We don’t start our concierge onboarding calls by asking about our product or the signup process. <strong>Our goal is to win customer trust, get insight, and motivate the customer to change behavior &#8211; using the product is secondary.</strong></p>
<p>Asking about the product puts the customer in the leading position &#8211; we want to lead the customer. We use the GROW coaching technique on our concierge onboarding calls.</p>
<p>Getting the customer talking about Goals, current Reality, and Obstacles (the G, R, O) allows us to interview the customer in a casual conversation.</p>
<h2 id="step4-evaluatewithyourteam">Step 4 &#8211; Evaluate with your team</h2>
<p>After the call just type up your notes in a quick summary. We post them to Google docs and drop a snippet into Slack so the whole team can scan them.</p>
<p>Then we have a follow-on call to review.</p>
<h2>Results? Continuous learning about our customers while building the business</h2>
<p>Customer Development doesn&#8217;t end when you roll-out the MVP. It continues until you hit product/market fit and your SAAS app builds stable MRR with growth.</p>
<p>Concierge onboarding is a great way to keep this learning going while you&#8217;re building the business &#8211; it just becomes part of your workflow.</p>
