More and more SaaS companies consider "onboarding" to be a distinct sales function and not a product issue. Many - [like Customer.io](/blog/customerio) - are even hiring specialists to do onboarding.

In this post I’ll offer fellow SaaS founders some advice on hiring for onboarding.

## Successful onboarding starts with the founder

Successful SaaS founders invest a lot of time onboarding customers in the first year or two of operations.

The founder is usually a domain expert in subjects like marketing, sales, product development, etc and uses that expertise to build close relationships with early customers.

The founder “does things that don’t scale” and spends a lot of time helping early customers achieve their business goals.

## The founder’s dilemma - hiring the first onboarding specialist

This investment pays off - trial customers trust the founder, convert to paying customers, and don’t cancel.  But as the company grows the founder can’t build relationships with every new customer and needs to hire someone to do it.

Some founders - like me - have a hard time imagining someone else doing onboarding. We leverage our domain expertise to win new customer trust and assume others need to be domain experts like us to have credibility with customers.

This is a mistake.

## The #1 goal in onboarding is creating the "will" in the customer to change behavior

After a year or two of steady growth most SaaS apps begin to mature and product issues (design, usability, features, etc.) are no longer barriers to customer adoption.

Instead, the customers’ unwillingness to change behavior is the primary adoption barrier.

####Example: LessAccounting

LessAccounting did a great job of introducing a better product than Quickbooks for small businesses. But the first time I tried LessAccounting I had a difficult time understanding how to enter expenses because I wasn’t used to dealing with a different way to think of accounting. I bailed on the product simply because I didn’t want to learn a new way to work.

An onboarding specialist needs to help customers overcome these barriers by creating the will to work differently. This is exactly what coaches do - create will for change.

## Hire coaches to do onboarding

Coaches (or teachers) are rarely domain experts - instead, they are great at identifying our goals and helping us create the will to overcome obstacles in achieving them.

We advocate the GROW coaching framework to do concierge onboarding.

+ Work with trial customers to achieve agreement on the customer’s *Goal*s.
+ Help the customer assess the current *Reality*.
+ Identify *Obstacles*.
+ Create the *Will* for customers to overcome the Obstacles and achieve Goals.

## How an onboarding coach works

For example, my *Goal* in signing up for LessAccounting was to spend less time doing accounting. My *Reality* was that I was using QuickBooks and hating it. The *Obstacle* was that I didn’t commit to spending ~1-2 hours learning a new way to do bookkeeping.

An onboarding specialist could have created the *Will* for me to change by helping me clarify my Goals and see that a small investment of effort would ultimately have huge long-term benefits. This can be done over a quick phone call and a few follow-up emails.

Hiring a teacher or coach is a lot easier than hiring a specialist. There are tons of qualified candidates worldwide looking for opportunities to work with tech companies.
