18 months ago I wrote a free book called [Beginning Customer Development]() based on my own experiences practicing and teaching Lean Startup strategies for the last 6 years. While the book is a good general guide for all new businesses, I’ve been developing specific Customer Development strategies for building (and selling) SaaS products.

In this post I’ll present a more effective way to validate customer problems than traditional interviews.

## Why you can’t find customers to talk to

If you’ve read anything about Lean Startup or Customer Development you’ve probably heard about customer interviews. Since the biggest risk for startups is building something nobody wants, it makes sense to first validate your product idea by talking to customers. If you’re not solving a real problem or customers don’t want to buy your solution you can save a ton of time by talking to a few dozen of them before building anything.

Theoretically … yes … but my recent experience has been different.

#### Real customers are sick of problem discussions

A lot of the theory around Customer Development was developed in the late 1990s when building software was really expensive. Customers didn’t have the money to do it themselves so they relied on vendors to do it. This was the heyday of companies like SAP, Microsoft, and Cisco.

Customers were so desperate for innovation that simply having VC funding was enough to get detailed meetings with CXOs to learn about problems and collaboratively develop solutions.

Today? Customers are overwhelmed by the number of products [that are doubling every year](http://chiefmartec.com/2015/01/marketing-technology-landscape-supergraphic-2015/). Most of these founders have studied product marketing strategies like Solution Selling or Customer Development  - and they’re all emailing the same customers asking for meetings to talk about problems.

Customers are sick of it. Unless you give them a compelling reason to have a meeting you’re unlikely to get a meaningful conversation.

## Customer Development interviews for *All Aboard!*

I found myself in this situation 6 months ago and came up with a different approach to quickly get customer interviews and insight.

We had an idea for a new product based on what we learned from our SoHelpful customers. We noticed our SaaS customers were using SoHelpful - like us - to do “concierge” onboarding with their trial subscribers and reporting great results in growing MRR.

I hypothesized a solution but needed to validate it with real customers. At the time I was living in Beijing and China and needed to quickly schedule a few dozen conversations to see if our idea had merit.  I needed to talk to other SaaS founders and VPs of Customer Success - people halfway around the world who were just as busy as me.

I realized that finding enough of them, scheduling and doing Skype interviews was going to take me longer than hacking the MVP. I needed to give these potential customers a good reason to want to get on a call with me.  

In the words of Neil Rackham (Spin Selling) I needed to offer a “conversation so compelling they would be willing to pay for it.”

#### A conversation they might pay for

Chiara and I talked about it and decided to offer to train other SaaS founders on doing concierge onboarding. We had spent 6 months refining our own workflow and process and offered to share the strategies with other SaaS founders.

I sent about 50 warm emails to friends and colleagues asking for references. Here is the email I used:

——

Hey Jack,

Great catching up over the holidays, hope you and the family are well

If you know anyone who is also a SaaS founder (and products sell around the same price point as yours) I would appreciate an intro.  Here are a few sentences you can send them, feel free to edit away:

---
I'm Kevin Dewalt (about me), SaaS startup founder and Angel Investor.

I'm currently developing best practices & products to help other SaaS companies increase trial-to-paying subscriber conversions through "concierge" onboarding. Fast-growing SaaS companies [like Customer.io](#) have been using similar strategies to double conversions.

I'm happy to jump on a 30-minute call and talk about ways to customize concierge onboarding for your product.

Just contact me at kevindewalt@kevindewalt.com or @kevindewalt if you're interested.

The experiment worked and I was able to line up 1-2 meetings a day for a few weeks - enough data to see that we were on the right track.

#### How we conducted the calls

I would start the calls by doing sending them a generic presentation about concierge onboarding strategies.

[Here it is](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cDeg04ko2qTxPhvd2HvquRd45qDHDH7DyimCjPPhZV0/edit?usp=sharing) in case you want to copy it.

 I would use the slides to guide the discussions, but mostly we talked about their business, how they worked, what did/didn’t work for them, their goals - the same information I wanted to learn from a Customer Development interview.

#### We lead TO our solution

The best part? By educating customers on a better way to work we were positioning *All Aboard!* as a solution to helping them achieve their greater goals without having to “sell” the anything. A few of these conversations lead to our initial customers.

## Bottom line: Don’t ask for meetings. Offer to teach them a better way to work

Offering to teach customers is a great way to validated a B2B SaaS product idea. A customer who signs up for your training is offering to trade you the most valuable currency they have: their time.  That action alone indicates they’re looking for a new way to solve their problems.

Best of all, you’ll jump to the head of the line of everyone else looking to “interview” them about their problems.
