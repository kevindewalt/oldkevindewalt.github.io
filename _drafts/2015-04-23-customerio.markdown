*[Customer.io](http://customer.io/) is an app that enables you to send targeted human emails to your users. In [2014](http://customer.io/is-open/2014-Year-in-review.html), they hit 500+ paying customers and $1.5 million in annual recurring revenue.*

Does your product solve a hard problem? Chances are, customers find your product challenging to use. It’s difficult to onboard them. The thing is, when you study how to do onboarding, the answer is mostly, “Make it as fast, easy, and painless as possible!” Not very helpful.

That’s why I was so excited to interview Janet Choi, Customer.io’s Marketing Manager.

People find email confusing and there are many, different providers. How does Customer.io get people to choose *and* use them? Read this post to learn how a successful company with a self-admitted challenging product onboards new customers.

###"Customer onboarding for challenging products" with Janet Choi

Why do users churn off?

Messaging platforms can feel really confusing and there are lots of providers. More than anything else, it’s fit.

We need to make sure it’s a good fit for customers.

###Onboarding emails can do this for you, but you have to do them well.

You really have to test them, and that can feel uncomfortable.

We all have this idea that our product speaks for itself once we get people in the door. This is why most businesses focus on acquisition more than retention.

You don’t think you’re going to lose the things you have, so you focus on getting more. It’s like money — you don’t think about how much you’re spending, but how much more you can get.

We *are* working on a series of emails… But it’s one of those things that keeps getting pushed back on your todo list.

Either that, or people do them (emails) loosey goosey…

###But if you want to do email well, it's critical that you understand customers at the beginning stages.

When I joined Customer.io, I was really eager to talk to customers.

Why do they use it? How? I spent the holidays reading through support tickets.

By doing this, I got a sense of what people are dealing with:

*It’s hard to get up and running.* They're confused when they get in the door.

How do you do something? *They don’t want to look it up.*

Can your tool do this? Or, I want to do this. *Help me figure it out.*

If I hadn’t done that, I wouldn’t know what our customers cared about… You need that understanding to both market to and retain customers.

###You need to go through the Concierge Onboarding process.

We started doing Concierge Onboarding to learn how to onboard new people and get them to actually use the product…

We’d have conversations with customers. We ask them why they are here. We try to figure out how we can help. 

Sometimes, it’s by admitting we’re not a good fit.

We almost don’t talk in the beginning. We listen. What we do NOT do is say, "Here’s who we are. Buy our product.”

It worked.

Plus, when we looked at our numbers for the whole year? **Our sales for the months we were doing concierge were higher.**

When Colin stopped, they dropped.

The interaction in the beginning makes a difference.
