Benefits of follow up --

1. Saying that you're going to follow up makes it more likely people will take action
2. It gives you a reason to stay in touch, which is always good, because as Rob Walling said, one of the biggest mistakes in marketing automation is letting the list get cold. The more reasons you have to stay in touch, the better.
3. Customers are genuinely impressed with people who follow up. There's no competition. It's so easy, but nobody does it. You can even automate it, which I'll show you later. But because nobody does it, it's fucking impressive to see someone follow up.

Why do I do it?

1. Super huge ROI. It's so easy and doesn't take a long time, "Hey did you get my email?" but most people feel guilty and reply to a follow up email. They know you're serious. When I'm emailing someone cold, I've learned not to expect a reply. I used to feel hurt, but really, it's not me. It's them.
2. The fastest way to make an impersonal email personal
3. People are overwhelmed. When somebody doesn't reply it's usually them, not you. Don't take it personally.

How do I do it?

1. At the end of a concierge onboarding call, I'll ask someone if I can follow up with him in 2 weeks. 2 weeks because it's a reasonable amount of time she can take action. People are busy. Most people will be pleasantly surprised and say yes to this. And it makes compliance higher too. They think, oh this person will follow up with me. I better do it then.
2. While the conversation is fresh in my mind, I write an email saying, "Hey Chiara, following up on our conversation two weeks ago. How's it going on the customer outreach?" then hit send later, select 2 weeks later.

That's it. I'm done. I can hit send later and never even think about it. 2 weeks later, I'll get an email saying wow, thanks for following up, yeah i did this and i got a client. or I wasn't able to... What do you think?

They give you feedback on what's worked and what hasn't worked for them and you can use that data to improve your advice or your app or whatever.
