Hot dog stands and other types of startups who shouldn't do concierge onboarding.

<br>

We’ve mostly talked about the benefits of concierge onboarding.

In this post, we talk about who it is *not* for. Because concierge onboarding is definitely not for everyone.

Yes, you can scale concierge onboarding by [qualifying customers](http://blog.sohelpful.io/blog/qualify/) and [hiring coaches to do it](http://blog.sohelpful.io/blog/hire-coaches-to-do-saas-onboarding/)… But for three types of companies, concierge onboarding is just not worth doing.

###What concierge onboarding can accomplish that lifecycle emails, tool tips, and UI optimizations cannot

The ability to engage a customer in a dialogue.

That's the main benefit concierge onboarding can deliver, which popular onboarding methods (lifecycle emails, tool tips, etc.) cannot.

Dialogue lets you understand where the customer is coming from, which forms the foundation for getting him to think differently, and therefore, do things differently.

For three types of companies, this is overkill. You don’t need the customer to think and act differently. You just need him to pick you over the competition.

###Three types of companies where concierge onboarding is overkill

	1. You’re looking for a one-time sale, not a subscription. 

Since people buy on emotion, telling a persuasive and compelling story is enough to drive **a one-time sale**.

If you sell books, training courses, and information products, you don’t need to do concierge onboarding. Just write copy convincing a customer that if he buys your product, his life will never, ever be the same again.

With one-time sales, people look at the book on the shelf that they never opened and think, “Oh well."

Not so with subscriptions. Every time a customer gets billed, he questions your product's value.

	2. Simple — Your product can be put alongside other known products on a shelf. 

For simple products, behavioral emails and UI changes are enough — customers are sold on the problem and solution, you just need to nudge them towards *yours*.

Examples are consumer products that people already need and use such as Google Hangout, Skype, and (my favorite), Zoom.

	3. You’re competing on price.

The value of what you sell is known and your strategy is to be the cheapest provider.

If you’re aiming to be cheaper than Amazon or Walmart, you don’t need to do concierge onboarding.

To flip this...

###Here's how you know if concierge onboarding is worth doing in your startup

**1. You charge a subscription.** And therefore, need your customers to change their behavior and use your product regularly.

**2. Your SaaS app is complex.** You’re doing something disruptive. You need to sell the customer not only on choosing *your* company as a provider, but that he even has a problem worth taking action on.

**3. You compete on value.** You strategy is to price high and provide 10x the value.

This is the case for most B2B SaaS companies. You’re doing something innovative and disruptive.

You're so ahead of the market, your customer is not even looking for a solution to the problem you’re solving yet…

[The Challenger Sale](http://www.amazon.com/Challenger-Sale-Control-Customer-Conversation-ebook/dp/B0052REP7K/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&sr=&qid=) sums the issue perfectly:

>It’s not that you’re asking customers to buy your product and put it up on the shelf with all of the other products they’ve bought. Rather, you’re asking customers to change their behavior — to stop acting in one way and starting acting in another. To make that happen, you have to get customers to think differently about how they operate. You need to show them a new way to think about their business.

**If you're selling a recurring subscription that's complex and competes on value... You need to do concierge onboarding and get customers to think differently.**
