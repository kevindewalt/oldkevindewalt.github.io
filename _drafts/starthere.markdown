If you're new to the SoHelpful blog, welcome!

This site is for B2B SaaS apps. You'll learn about the concierge onboarding movement, how companies are using it to 2x, or even 3x, the number of free trial users converting to paying customers, and how you can do it too.

**Why concierge onboarding? Is this for you?**

Like most SaaS apps, we spent way too much time thinking lack of prospects at the "top of the funnel" was causing our slow growth. Here's [how we became concierge onboarding evangelists](http://blog.sohelpful.io/about/)

What's "onboarded" anyway? The most popular definition is 'once they’ve achieved “initial success” with your product' but plenty of our trial customers take a critical step, get some “First Value” - and then abandon the product a week later. So here's a more practical definition:
[How to know when your customer is onboarded](http://blog.sohelpful.io/blog/defining-onboarded/).

*This sounds like too much work. Can’t I just send auto-responders?*

No, [dont' start your SaaS app with lifecycle emails](http://blog.sohelpful.io/blog/lifecycle/).

Why? Because [Concierge Onboarding is Continuous Customer Development](http://blog.sohelpful.io/2015/02/07/concierge-onboarding-is-continuous-customer-development/) and you should learn from [Help Scout: learn everything there is to learn, and then automate](http://blog.sohelpful.io/2015/02/07/concierge-onboarding-is-continuous-customer-development/).

**Enough theory - Let’s grow your MRR**
