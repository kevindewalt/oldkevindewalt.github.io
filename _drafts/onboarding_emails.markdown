>Does this stuff actually work??

<!--what is "this stuff"? Maybe "Is this really for me?" I think you start out with a critical perspective here that you can carry through to the examples. These emails don't put themselves in the shoes of a real customer - just some fantasy person they have dreamed up who is thrilled to have discovered our wonderful product. You do that a bit in the examples but I think you can drive home the point more forcefully - like what you personally are *really* thinking when you get them. -->

<!--Also I think you can say more about the company with out giving away names: "this is from a venture-backed Techstars startup (or whatever)" -->

Is what my brain demands every time I get a welcome email after signing up for an app.

This onboarding email is extremely important to us.

How well we do it determines if the customer ever uses the app and how long she gets values and stays subscribed to the service, among many other important things.

Josh Elman, who did user onboarding for Twitter and LinkedIn, sums it up well when he said,

>Most services are like, "Awesome I’m gonna make the sign up flow as painless as possible and just jump you right into the product."

>That’s a terrible idea. Right after somebody signs up for your service is **your moment**. You have more attention than you ever will have again from that user to try to teach them what your product is really about.”
--Josh Elman on [The Secrets to Driving Massive User Growth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaMqCWOfA1o)

We've done a lot of experimenting and testing on what works and what doesn't in onboarding emails. **We've went from getting ignored by everybody to getting 9 out of 10 customers to self-schedul onboarding calls with us.** Not the easiest thing to do.

So I thought it’d be useful and fun to compile actual welcome emails and give my thoughts on:

+ How to make them more effective
+ The psychology behind good welcome emails
+ The actual template we use that gets 90% of customers to self-schedule calls with us

By the end of this post, you'll learn how to avoid wasting the critical moment that is the welcome email and how to use it to do whatever your customer needs to do get onboarded.

*These are real welcome emails, but with people and apps's names changed.*


<!--As I skim through the text I have a hard time separating the emails from each other. Maybe say ... EXAMPLE 1 with more space.-->

##Bad Welcome Email 1: "The Annoying One"
-----
>Hi

>My name is John and I will be your account representative as you evaluate ABC app. I will be calling you in next few mins to introduce myself and understand your requirements.

>Meanwhile, please do not hesitate to write to me if you have any questions.

>We look forward to having you onboard successfully and we welcome to ABC app once again.

>
John, Customer Success Manager


####Why annoying?

<!--ordered lists only work in markdown if you do them sequentially together. Use MOU (or some other markdown editor and you'll see the result below. ) -->

1. I respect John's hustle, but interrupting customers by calling them is time-consuming and it seldom works.

A few months ago, when I 'forced' customers to get on calls with me by scheduling them on their SoHelpful.me profiles -- thinking it'll work because they get an agenda, notifications, and calendar entries  -- customers didn't show up for  calls.

So I doubt calling customers right out of the gate, even warning them about it on email, works.

I also personally think it's annoying and presumptous that I want to talk to them.

2. Filler phrases: “Please do not hesitate to write to me” and “we welcome you to ABC app”

These words are so often repeated that they lose their meaning.

Customers do not feel welcome. And they will almost never write you at all, unless you do something that makes them angry. Not good if you actually want their feedback and thoughts.

###How to fix the The Annoying One

1. Don't make it obvious that this is a canned email.

Make a customer feel special, like she's the only person in your world right now, by writing something personal.

You can do this fast. A compliment on a recent blog post or company name or whatever.

<!--I think we can discuss the cold-call directly. From our custdev some do find this effective. But it interrupts workflow (ours and theirs, you get a lot of voicemail, some hate it as you point out, and it doesn't work at all if you are more than 4 timezones apart). Also this one is just wishful thinking. Is the customer really sitting their with baited breath waiting for wonderful John to call? Staring longingly at the phone... more likely she never even read it. -->

2. Get the customer's buy-in on the call.

Don't force customers to be rude and ignore your call and email. Let them self-schedule with you.

By doing this, you are respectful of their time, you get their buy-in on the call, making the call likely to happen.

This makes a HUGE difference.

###The Dangerous One

<!--Maybe a different name? Not sure I see the danger... The generic one? -->

<!--I guess I see the issue with this one is that it just starts with fluff and has a lot of words without actually saying anything except: "go do this work now"" (read a bunch of stuff) and gives support info. Or send a tweet? Why would the customer do that.  This email is basically a wasted opportunity - it says nothing. -->

>Great to have you on board!

>You just joined hundreds of thousands of people who have taken back control of their email and their sales process with APP. Now you have the actionable intelligence you need to work more efficiently and stay connected to your most important contacts.
>
The best way to learn APP is to jump right in and start using it. We've pooled together some helpful tips to lend a hand if you ever get stuck or want to learn more: <u>You can read them here</u>.
>
Have any questions or feedback? You can always get in touch with us at support@APP.com, or send us a tweet @APP. We're here to help and we'd love to hear from you

###Why is this dangerous?

It looks like it does everything right.

It reinforces the buying decision with social proof and the value you'll get.

It lets the customer decide which channel she wants.

It's an *okay* email IF your goal is to let the customer know that the helpful tips document exists...

This email is dangerous because it gives you the impression that it is doing its job, but in fact, it's probably not doing anything, because it's not clear on what it wants to accomplish.

###How to make The Dangerous One less so

The welcome email is such a critical touch point... At no time will you have more of the customer’s attention than now.

It's worth it to only achieve one thing, and achieve it right, whether it's making the customer read the tips or giving feedback.

Be clear on what you want it to accomplish and let the whole email support that goal.

###Seriously???

<!--I didn't realize this was another email. This is the f* you one from my perspective. So you want to learn how I'm using it? You want me to waste my time trying the schedule a call with you? What is in it for me? F* you. -->

>Hi Chiara,
>I saw that you signed up for our API and I wanted to learn more about how you were using it. Is there a time this week we can chat real quick to discuss it?

>Thanks,
>John

Send this email if you don't want to learn how your customers are using your API.

I have NO IDEA what’s in it for me to spend even a few minutes on a call with a stranger.

Even if I did want to give my thoughts, I'd have to look at my calendar and when I’m free.

It’s painful and I won’t do it.

###How to improve this email

1. Give me a reason to tell you about how I’m using your API.

Understand my situation and where you can most likely provide value… Where do others get stuck? Can you tell me what good things happen as a result of customers getting on a call with you?

2. Instead of assuming I want to get on a call and making me go through the pain of looking at my calendar... Make it a ‘2-step opt-in.’

<!--I think you can say something like "make it easy for customers to schedule a call"" or something like that. -->

Get my buy in first, “Can I get your advice?”, then *if* I reply, make it easy on me and suggest 3-4 times you think I'm available. Make it easy on me.

One of the worst questions ever is “What time are you free this week?”

<!-- You totally lost me below.... is this an email? I think you can just cut this content from close.io and use it as another post. -->

###An excellent example of understanding that onboarding is sales

-----

###Why this works

Lots of reasons. But some of the most important ones:

1. Benefit-oriented. Makes it clear who this is for and what they’ll get
2. Credibility. Of the best ones: testimonials doing the bragging for you
3. Facts, not opinions. They're not going, “I’m the best sales trainer ever,” but here are some of what I've achieved. Success 1. Success 2. Success 3. Up to you if you think I’m a guy who can help you.
4. Really understands the customer and her objections. Last paragraph consoles me that it’s not a sales call.
5. Despite all the information, it has a clear call to action: Send an email to this address.

###A short but effective onboarding message

>We're offering you a free one-on-one consultation to learn how to build a more valuable network. If you want to schedule a call with one of our networking experts, please let us know the biggest struggle you have in connecting with influential people to your success and we'll in touch soon.
What's your biggest struggle for networking?

###What makes this effective?

1. Credibility: Great, I’d love to talk to a networking expert.
2. It’s not a generic “Let me know how I can help” offer. The question is very clear, “What is your biggest struggle?” and it triggers me to think of my specific thoughts: What my challenges are right now with regards to connecting with influential people.
3. Clear and easy call to action

Finally...

<!--Instead of personal comments, why not use a real email you sent? You can take a screenshot of Gmail or put the text here. -->

Despite the many examples, there are actually only a few key principles that make emails work or not work. Here they are.

<!--You could make this another post. -->

###The 6 principles of a highly effective welcome email:

1. Make your subject line as personal as possible. People are so tired of being treated as subscribers and metrics... We handtype the welcome email to each customers, but that's not enough. Be explicit in the subject line that you handtyped it.
2. Make the email personal -- You may be sending a template that's used on hundreds or thousands of people... But as far as the person you're sending it to is concerned -- he's the only person you're sending an email to. Even if he suspects you're sending this to a lot of people, it breaks his pattern and makes him think... *Huh Maybe I'm the only he does this to? He did take the time to mentioni my most recent blog post*
3. Nobody wants to get on calls with sales reps or support people. Let them know you're a big deal in the company but are making time for them.
4. Help your customers succeed. Dont be, “I want to help you use SoHelpful better.” Insteady, say, "I want to help you get more customers. It can be about SoHelpful, but it’s cool if it’s not. I’m personally invested in your success." That's the whole point of starting a company.
5. Social proof: Almost all of our new customers take advantage of this opportunity
7. Clear and easy CTA: Click this, grab a slot on my schedule, and we’ll get on a call.

Bonus. This line is killer and works everywhere: Share best practices from others in your business

Onboarding, especially the welcome email, is sales. Don't waste this critical opportunity with fluff.
