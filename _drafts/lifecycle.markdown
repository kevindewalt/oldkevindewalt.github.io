###Lifecyle emails are not the holy grail for conversions
>I just have a welcome email and one for 10 days before  trial ends. So far 3/7 recipients open it, of which only one is still active. I guess next step is to set up a bunch more automated emails...

This is an actual message I just received <!-- from...? --> .  It's a common one. And it’s also exactly how I used to think.

We all know that increasing conversions requires getting customers more engaged with our apps. And conventional wisdom suggests that lifecycle emails are the solution to engagement.

<!--opening is a bit awkward. I see where you're going but I think you have to be clearer up front. -->

###But what do you write in lifecycle emails?

Common advice says, you should:

+ Reverse engineer the steps to the “ah-ha!” moment
+ Track your results
+ Tweak and optimize

This sounds like it makes sense... But another way of saying it? Is do a lot of thinking on your own, put out a bunch of emails, and try to guess what’s working and what’s not.


Put this way, it obviously will not increase your conversions.

But I used to beat myself up over not knowing what to write in these emails. And so do many founders who've told me they're going to spend a few weeks setting up a bunch of automated emails.

So to save you from this frustration, I want to share with you one idea that became very clear to me after interviewing a bunch of successful SaaS companies for the [Things That Don't Scale](http://blog.sohelpful.io/things_dont_scale/):

<!--from this point on it reads great and flows perfectly. I think you just need to tighten up the first 2 sections above, hit the major point strong. Lifecycle emails are not very effective in the beginning. We don't really know what to write so it takes forever - because we're basically guessing. Customers don't really open or read them so it just fills their inboxes. Successful SAAS companies don't work like this. -->

###Just starting? You're not supposed to know what to write in lifecycle emails.

You can't think your way through this challenge.

**In fact, I'd go as far as to say that  you do NOT "write" lifecyele emails.**

The process of creating lifecycle emails is less thinking and writing... And more about talking to customers, documenting what you're learning, and transcribing them into emails.

Every company I've interviewed told me:

>Absolutely. You have to do manual at first.

They say it like it's the most obvious thing in the world.

Like it doesn’t even occur to them to try to write a bunch of automated emails from the outset.

###How successful companies figure out what engages customers

They formulate hypotheses, then talk to customers to validate them.

Nick Francis, founder of Help Scout, told me that for the first 6-8 months, they required phone numbers at sign up.

If you’re thinking this will lower the conversion rate,  you are correct.

They weren't optimizing for sales at all. They just wanted to understand what business their customers are in, what their customer support processes are, their daily email volume, etc.

And they wanted to  check on them throughought the process.

[Rob Walling](http://blog.sohelpful.io/blog/robwalling/), founder of Drip, said that at the beginning, he spent 20 hours/week manually onboarding customers.

He sent emails manually from Gmail. He recorded one-off screencasts. He screenshared. He even did stuff for customers.

It was all manual.

###A simple strategy for figuring out what to write in lifecycle emails

So if you're thinking of spending the next few weeks writing a bunch of automated emails?

Do something more productive: Manually onboard your customers by doing [Concierge Onboarding](http://blog.sohelpful.io/sohelpfulio/).

Try this:

+ Make a hypothesis of 3 things your customers would need to do to get onboarded
+ Write a [welcome email](http://blog.sohelpful.io/blog/onboarding_emails/) offering to get on a call with them
+ While on the call, do [GROW coaching](http://blog.sohelpful.io/blog/challenge-customers-during-your-saas-startups-onboarding/), and offer to follow up in 2 weeks
+ Schedule it in your calendar to follow up in 2 weeks to learn what they successfully did, where they got stuck, etc.

Aim to do this with at least your next 25 customers.

The more you talk to customers, the clearer the patterns will be... What to write in your lifecyecle emails will become obvious.

We'll get more detailed in a future post. But the point is you should stop feeling frustrated your automated emails are not working... It's impossible to get them right at the outset.

Instead, get your customers on the phone to manually onboard them, and document what you're learning.
