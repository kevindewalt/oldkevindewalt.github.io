Paying customers were churning right off.

Free trial users stopped converting into paying customers.

*Even though our product, marketing, and understanding of customers were better.*

We didn't know what to do to get MRR growing again?

So we followed popular advice like “make the onboarding process as fast and easy as possible!” and “send automated lifecycle emails!”

But they didn’t work.

Finally, we went back to basics and did “things that don’t scale” to onboard new users. We got them on the phone, discussed their goals and challenges, and helped them understand how to use SoHelpful to achieve their goals.

There’s even a term for it: Concierge Onboarding.

And it worked! That’s why this site exists.

If that sounds useful to you, you’re in the right place.

#Here’s what we’re all about:

###Increasing MRR by reducing churn and increasing conversions through Concierge Onboarding

+ How do you identify and invest in your most qualified customers?
+ What do you email to customers? When do you do it?
How do you coach customers to change behavior and get the most out of your product?
+ How do you hire and train customer success reps to do this?

In fact, we’ve built a tool to optimize and get the benefits of manually onboarding each customer without a lot of time: [SoHeplful.io](http://try.sohelpful.io/)

###No theory. Only truth and what works from the trenches.

You won’t see BS business fiction here. No growth hacking and automating your way to $1 million in a month. No theories and consultants on what you ‘should’ be doing.

Just business people in the trenches practicing what we preach and sharing stories, tools, and lessons learned.

###Useful content, yes. But good writing, too.

You could be in a million other sites right now, but you choose to spend your time with us. We respect that.

There’s already too much crap on the internet. So no listicles, fluff, and writing for content marketing’s sake here. Only stuff you can use.

###We want to hear from you, for real.

What are your challenges with conversions? Churn? What would be useful to you?
