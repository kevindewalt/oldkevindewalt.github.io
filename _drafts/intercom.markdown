I've been talking to many of the people in our [concierge onboarding course](http://try.allaboard.io/concierge.html). One of the most common stories is this: 

1. They are paying for Intercom
2. They want to use it as more than a dumping ground for customers, but they're not sure how.
3. They want to do concierge onboarding inside Intercom.

If that sounds like you, great news. Intercom is a great place to do concierge onboarding in. 

In fact, internally and for selected customers, we're currently using an Intercom version of All Aboard! If you email me, I will help you set up Intercom so you can do concierge onboarding inside it, the way we lay out in the [course](http://try.allaboard.io/concierge.html).

For now, I want to show you the best way to start getting value out of Intercom.

##Focusing on customers most likely to convert

In email 5 of the course, we talk about why qualifying your customers when they sign up is important:

**Not all customers are created equal.** You need to find the ones with the most potential to grow your business, and concierge onboard them.

Besides, it will save you from a lot of heartache when you find that nobody's responding to your emails... 

The biggest determinant of whether someone will respond to you or not isn't how well-written your welcome email is, or even how well you follow up, but... **Who the user is!**

Perry Marshall said it best in 80/20 Sales and Marketing:

>**Selling to the right person is more important than all the sales methods, copywriting techniques, and negotiation tactics in the world.** Because the wrong person doesn’t have the money. Or the wrong person doesn’t scare. The wrong person won’t be persuaded by anything.

This is true as well for who's likely to schedule a call with you. Your job isn't to change the mind of someone who doesn't care. It is to identify who already cares, and invest your time on them.

With that said, here's a quick 3-step process to help you qualify customers so you can start getting what you want out of Intercom.

##How to qualify customers on Intercom

###Step 1: Tag each customer as "High," "Medium," or "Low."

Right now, view All Users, go through each person, and look at (1) **who** they are, (2) **what** they've done, and (3) **how much** they're likely to pay you.

The specific attributes to look at depends on your business, but here's what we look at:

+ **Who**: Email address (business? hotmail?), country, app / company
+ **What**: Did he integrate a service like Drip or Mailchimp?
+ **How much**: What plan did he sign up for?

If you have an overwhelming number of users there (great problem to have) take the last 30 days' or 2 weeks'. Whatever feels doable.

From now on, every time a new user signs up, take a few seconds to tag (or qualify) him.

###Step 2: Create a segment for your "High" customers.

If you get less than 300 users a month, I suggest you also create a segment for your "Medium" customers.

The point is to have easy acces to the 20% of customers that will generate 80% of the value for your business. Keep them in front of you so you can follow up, see what they are doing, etc.

In other words, so you can focus on them.

###Step 3: Invite High-qualified customers to an onboarding call.

Steps 1 and 2 took care of qualifying. But while we're here, let's take this to the next step and get your best customers on an onboarding call.

Once you're getting users on calls, they're more likely to convert. Period. 

The difficult part is getting someone to schedule a call with you. We'll write more about that, but for now, the most important idea to keep in mind is that **you sell the onboarding call as an opportunity**.

The best way to do that is to use this script:

---

**subject line**: [Your app's name] (I hand-typed this email)

**body**:

Hey [customer's name], great to see you here.

My name is [your name], I do [what you do] for [name of your app].

Thanks for signing up for [name of your app]. I also checked out [URL to customer's site or blog].

I'd like to help you achieve your goals of [goal customer wants to achieve from signing up for your app] and share best practices from others in your business. Almost all of our new customers take advantage of this opportunity.

Ideally, you end by linking him to your scheduler such as https://allaboard.io/chiaracokieng. If you don't have one, suggest two to three time slots you think the customer will be available. ("Can you do a quick 30-minute call on X, Y, or Z?")

**Take a few seconds to tag your customers, create a segment, and focus on your highest-value customers.** The best salespeople know this. It's so obvious to them, but it's underrated in the automation-obsessed SaaS world.

Trust me, identifying customers most likely to get value from using your app is a very profitable activity. That's why Intercom invests so much in enabling you to do it. Take advantage of it.
