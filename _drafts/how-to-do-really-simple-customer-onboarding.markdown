I wanted to go after more customers, but Kevin wouldn’t let me.

He said,

>Sure, customers are signing up. But they’re also churning off.

I couldn't believe it. I talk to customers all the time. They **love** SoHelpful!

So I looked at the numbers to show Kevin he was being delusional. Here's what I saw:

>Holy shit, our customers hate us!

We were signing up about 1 customer a day... And losing 15-18 per month. Damn it. Kevin is right.

We had a churn problem and we needed to fix it. Doing aggreessive marketing before then would be stupid.

### Studying Customer Onboarding

>...is the process of increasing the likelihood that new users become successful when adopting your product. --https://www.useronboard.com/

Fair enough.

So we studied what our most successful customers do.

First, we looked at customers who were using SoHelpful, and those who weren't.

We found that if a customer gets at least 1 Helpful call within his first month, he gets motivated to get on more calls and stays for at least 6 months.

Then, we asked the successful customers what they were doing to get people to call them.

With this knowledge, now we can teach our other customers to do those actions also. Awesome!

How to go about teaching them?

### Is it just me or is this really hard?

The how-tos on customer onboarding are all about optimizing the UI and sending customer lifecycle emails.

Stuff like:

* Remove anything in the way the "AH-HA" moment
* Answer common questions before they’re even asked
* Getting users to take action and get value, fast, without overwhelming them

Since our team is great at writing but dreadful at design, we decided to ignore the UI stuff and write an email course.

“Helpful Marketing Challenge,” we called it.

The idea is to teach our customers what the most successful SoHelpfulers do. We'll do this through an automated email course that sends bite-sized, daily, action-oriented messages.

We knew it's hard to get people to take action, but if we help them make and feel progress everyday... At the end of 30 days, a customer will have successfully gotten 3-5 Helpful calls -- the AH-HA! moment.

Then they'll see how valuable our product is and stay forever, right? Yey!

Since our sales course works so well -- people love it and free subscribers convert very well to paying customers -- we were supremely confident that this email course will work well too.

So we spent 2 months writing our onboarding course.

Guess what?

It didn't work.

It took a lot of time (your scarcest resource, especially if you're a small team)... Customers continued to churn off...

AND we trained our customers to ignore emails from us.

### Going back to what's important: helping customers achieve goals

After getting our month of highest churn ever, and after customers telling us they were feeling overwhelmed, blaming themselves, and still not sure what to do with out product... We killed Helpful Marketing Challenge.

We realized that for most startups:

+ Optimizing the UI is too hard, plus it doesn't make sense since the product keeps changing
+ Marketing automation emails are spam.

We know this because we started talking to other startups and here's what they said:

>Yeah, I got a lot of traction getting on the phone with each of my customers but since I stopped doing that, churn has been a real problem.

>I expected do this customer onboarding thing for a week. Now it's 2 months later, and I'm still at it.

>It's hard enough to optimize the UI, but because things keep changing, it feels like an absolute waste of time.

So we asked ourselves:

>What are we trying to do? And is there an easier way to do it?

The answer we got was ridiculously simple.

+ We want to help our customers reach their goals
+ We want to know what obstacles are holding them back
+ We want them to take action

Ultimately, doing these things will make them a more successful user and entrepreneur.

Since we're having such a difficult time *guessing* these things, why not just get them on the phone?

So we did that. "Concierge Onboarding," we called it.

And it worked!

Without doing anything else, we reduced our churn from losing 6 out of 10 people every month, down to 2 people.

If you're like most startups we’ve talked to, you’re losing too much money from customers churning off. But optimizing the UI and getting customer lifecycle emails right are too hard.

The insanely simple solution? Do Concierge Onboarding.

### Concierge Onboarding: The easiest and most effective way to onboard new users

Just get them on the phone.

Here's what I do once we're on the call:

+ Ask what their goals are
+ What they're already doing or wanting to do
+ What's holding them back
+ Summarize the conversation into 3 actions they say they want to do

Then I ask if they want me to follow up within 2 weeks. Getting on the phone is already unexpected. Asking to follow up definitely exceeds expectations...

But when they received my (scheduled) email to ask how things are going? They can't believe it.

**Almost nobody I've done this to has canceled yet.**

Is it worth 30 minutes of your time to get a customer for life? Of course.

Remember, with SaaS, every renewed subscription is a new sale.

You're probably thinking you're too busy to do this for all your customers yourself.

So in the next post, we'll talk about how to hire your first customer success agent that can do concierge onboarding for you.
