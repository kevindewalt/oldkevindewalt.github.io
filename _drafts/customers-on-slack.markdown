I've tried building customer communities on Facebook, Google+, Google Groups, and Yahoo! They were pretty much duds - just too hard to get customers engaged.

From day 1 we created a customer community on Slack for *All Aboard!*. So far it has been a huge win.

## 3 Slack strategies product teams are using

I've asked founders how they are using Slack for external communications. There a 3 general strategies:

#### For Beta Customer Feedback

This is the most common scenario. A product company invites beta customers to Slack for quick support and feedback. [Matt Goldman](https://hookfeed.com/) is using this strategy with Hookfeed - every single founder recommends it.

Your beta customers function like an extension of your team. Just invite them to your Slack team and communicate with DMs or private groups like I specify below. You'll build closer relationships with these special customers but you won't be creating a community.

#### Creating Watering Holes

 [Scott Tran](http://supportdriven.com/) shared this term with me. Most of us are hanging out on Slack all day and you can build a community of like-minded customers to engage around a topic of interest.

 Building a Slack Watering Hole is a "tribal" top-of-the-funnel marketing strategy. Identify prospective customers and invite them to the Slack team to collaborate on a business topic.

 You'll need to curate content, moderate, make introductions, and create channels to allow scaling - that is, it takes work. Otherwise it becomes a bs area for a handful of people.

#### Build a Customer community

This is the strategy we're using for *[All Aboard!](http://try.allaboard.io)* We engage our early customers about our product, use it as a platform for sharing Concierge Onboarding strategies, and generally help each other out.

It combines the best of the other strategies - but I don't know how well it will scale.

## How to build a customer community on Slack

#### Step 1 - Created a new Slack team organized around a theme - NOT your product

We created the "Concierge Onboarding" Slack team for SaaS companies like us. (team is Slack's term - it is kind of weird in this context).

I suggest starting with 3 channels:

1. **product-feedback channel** A place for you to announce features, problems or ask questions. Also for customers to tell you how bug-free and perfect your product is.  :-)
2. **strategy channel** Ours is co-strategy, where we share blog posts, tips, and ideas around SaaS onboarding. It helps to have a team member post articles regularly here.
3. **general channel** A place for customers and you to share anything, ask for help with promotion, etc.

#### Step 2 - Invite engaged customers

Like most B2B SaaS products, anyone can try *All Aboard!* for free without using a credit card. Most trial customers won't become subscribers - some won't even finish signing up.

We don't invite everyone, just those customers who connect their data and sign up for an onboarding call.

Don't worry about starting small. Nobody will care if your Slack customer community has only 5 people - so long as you invest time in all 5.


#### Step 3 - Create a private group for every customer

Create a private group for every customer. Invite <u>their entire team</u> and <u>your entire team</u> to the group. Encourage your customers to use the group instead of Direct Messages.

When we used DMs I became the bottleneck - and had to relay feedback to everyone else.

In a private group everyone can participate. Your dev team doesn't need to monitor every conversation - just @ them on critical issues.

#### Step 4 - Introduce new customers

It takes just a minute, but introducing a new customer and explaining what they're doing really breaks the ice and gets everyone talking. I try to do this right after my concierge onboarding call.

## Slack customer community pro tips

#### Do promotion rallies for big events

When Sorry! released on Product Hunt we encourage everyone to up-vote and comment. It takes 30 seconds - but it shows how much you care about customers' success.

#### Respond fast

Keep Slack open and respond fast - even if your response is "I'll get back to you tonight". Doing so will condition your customers to use Slack since they can expect instant results. Most questions can be answered in 5 seconds from your phone.

#### Share strategically relevant content

"Top 10 Ways to Get Re-Tweets" might be the greatest blog post ever written - but unless you're strategy involves social media ... skip it. Customers can read this stuff anywhere. Be focused, selective, and share the unique content around the strategy.

## The biggest benefit of customer communities? Creating a movement

I've got something to confess. It's horrible and I'm totally ashamed. I can't even believe I'm saying this aloud ...

*"I'm a founder and my product sucks."*

Breathe ... breathe ... There. I did it.

My product sucks. Your product sucks.

(Don't feel bad, the first iPhone sucked too.)

#### Customers don't care about your product

You and I, we're trying to change the world. It takes *years* to do that well with products but our customers don't care about our products - they care about themselves.

Our mission is lead our customers to achieve greater goals - to show them a better way to work.

#### Just lead with your vision

Build your customer community around this vision. Start with customers' goals and do whatever it takes to help them get there. Sometimes that means cranking out a new feature over a weekend, but many problems are easier to solve by people than code.

Teach. Learn. Share. Listen. Encourage.

Do that in your customer community and you're on your way to changing the world.
